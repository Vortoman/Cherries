# Cherry Game

This is a simple game build as a fullstack webapp, written in rust. The frontend is using yew and build with trunk. The backend is utilising actix_web and the 
spa (single page application) crate from actix_lab to serve both the frontend and the backend in the final code. Goal of this project was for me to learn how 
to write web applications in rust. 
To build the project move to the frontend folder and run "trunk build". Then run the application from the backend folder with "cargo run". Running both frontend
and backend with one command is accomplished with "spa" from "actix_lab".
